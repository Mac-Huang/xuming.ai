                <strong>Joy Buolamwini</strong> is a computer scientist at the MIT Media Lab and the founder of the <strong>Algorithmic Justice League</strong>. She is my "Tech Hero" because she directly challenges the norms of the tech space by exposing racial and gender bias in facial recognition systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a person of color, Buolamwini experienced firsthand how AI systems failed to "see" her face until she put on a white mask. This led to her groundbreaking research, "Gender Shades," which showed that AI from major companies had error rates of up to 34.7% for dark-skinned women, compared to 0.8% for light-skinned men.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her leadership in advancing equity is not just about the math; it's about the humans affected by these systems. She provides leadership by advocating for federal regulation of facial recognition and pushing for "algorithmic accountability." She is an ally to all those marginalized by biased data, and her work is a testament to how one can use technical expertise to fight for social justice.
