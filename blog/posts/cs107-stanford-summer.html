              CS 107 is my favorite course this summer, and I'm proud to say I earned an <span class="highlight">A+ (99/100)</span>. 
              This course on Computer Organization and Systems wasn't just about grades—it was a transformative experience that deepened 
              my understanding of how computers really work at the lowest levels.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Perfect Homework Design</h2>
            <p>
              The homework was exceptionally well designed and perfectly solidified the knowledge we learned in lectures. 
              It was my favorite part of the course—super interesting, challenging, and I learned tremendously from each assignment.

              <h3>Assignment 6: Heap Allocator</h3>
              <p>
                This was my absolute favorite assignment. Not only did I complete all the required functions, but I also 
                finished all the challenge functions that weren't required. I wanted to see how far I could push myself, 
                and I made it! I created a new structure that adds a footer at the end of free blocks to find the previous 
                block, implementing a bidirectional free list that significantly improved allocation efficiency.

              <h3>Assignment 5: Banking on Security</h3>
              <p>
                The Security Bomb assignment was one of the most intriguing challenges I've ever encountered. I successfully 
                found vulnerabilities in the virtual bank and "stole the money"—all in a controlled, educational environment, 
                of course! This assignment inspired me to explore real-life vulnerabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going beyond the assignment, I discovered some vulnerabilities in Stanford's AFS (Andrew File System). Following 
                responsible disclosure practices, I submitted the bugs properly and organized a comprehensive report with solutions, 
                all based on the honor code and vulnerability disclosure practices I learned from the lectures.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Huge thanks to Adam Keppler</strong> for helping me connect with the corresponding engineer, and a 
                <strong>big shout-out to Alex Keller</strong>—we had a very productive conversation about system security.

            <h2>Amazing Teaching Team</h2>
            
            <div class="instructor-section">
              <h3>Adam Keppler - The Inspiring Instructor</h3>
              <img src="../../images/blog/Me_and_Adam.jpg" alt="With Adam Keppler" class="blog-image">
              <p class="image-caption">With Adam Keppler after our final lecture</p>
              
              <p>
                Adam's teaching is simply amazing. He showed up to <em>every single lecture</em> with no exceptions, even though 
                we had two instructors. His dedication was inspiring. We had wonderful conversations about computer systems concepts, 
                my discovery of vulnerabilities, life, and everything in between.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I had never used GDB before this course, and I excitedly told him that I found a way to bypass the "bank protection 
                alert" in our security assignment. He appreciated that I was a quick learner and encouraged me to explore further.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                "I always asked tons of questions in lectures (that's pretty much why I sat in the first row!). Even when some 
                questions were basic, Adam patiently answered my confusion and followed my thanks with a big smile and 'Absolutely!' 
                His positive responses always inspired and encouraged students to think deeply."
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I genuinely believe Adam's teaching style and encouragement were key factors in my success in this course.

              <h3>Ola - Making Complex Topics Accessible</h3>
              <img src="../../images/blog/Me_and_Ola.jpg" alt="With Ola" class="blog-image">
              <p class="image-caption">With Ola after the last lecture on final review session</p>
              
              <p>
                Big thanks to Ola! Ola's humorous tone and teaching style made dense or potentially boring content feel 
                interesting and relaxing. The analogies and live demos helped me connect the dots between lecture material 
                and assignments in ways I hadn't expected.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                After class, Ola was always friendly and open to questions, offering clear explanations of complex concepts 
                that really helped solidify my understanding. Whether it was pointer arithmetic or assembly language intricacies, 
                Ola had a way of making everything click.

              <h3>Ben Yan - The Best TA I've Ever Met</h3>
              <img src="../../images/blog/Me_and_Ben.jpg" alt="With Ben Yan" class="blog-image">
              <p class="image-caption">Celebrating with Ben after the final lab</p> 
              
              <p>
                Ben Yan is, without a doubt, the best TA I have ever met. His slides weren't just informative—they were 
                engaging and sometimes even entertaining. His teaching was super fluent, like that of a seasoned lecturer, 
                and the meticulous, rigorous comments on our homework were incredibly helpful.
              </p>
              
              <img src="../../images/blog/Lets_go_ben.jpg" alt="Ben's teaching moment" class="blog-image">
              <p class="image-caption">Go for it, Ben!</p>

              <blockquote>
                "Please stick to your teaching—it's terrific, and I want to be the first student when you become a lecturer!"
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>
                Ben's discussion section was highlight of my week. He had this remarkable ability to break down complex 
                topics into digestible pieces while maintaining technical rigor. His feedback on assignments went above and 
                beyond, often including additional resources and suggestions for further exploration.

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
              CS 107 wasn't just about learning C programming or understanding computer architecture—it was about developing 
              a systems mindset. Through this course, I:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Mastered low-level programming and memory management</li>
              <li>Gained practical experience with debugging tools like GDB and Valgrind</li>
              <li>Developed a security-conscious approach to systems programming</li>
              <li>Learned the importance of responsible vulnerability disclosure</li>
              <li>Built lasting connections with amazing instructors and peers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>
              This course has fundamentally changed how I think about computer systems. The combination of theoretical knowledge 
              and hands-on implementation has given me confidence to tackle complex systems problems. I'm excited to apply these 
              skills in future projects and research.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              To anyone considering CS 107 at Stanford: take it! The workload is significant, but the learning experience is 
              unparalleled. With instructors like Adam and Ola, and TAs like Ben, you're not just learning material—you're 
              joining a community passionate about understanding how computers really work.
