            <p>
              Spending my summer at Stanford was an incredible academic journey. I took two challenging courses that fundamentally 
              changed how I think about computer science: <span class="highlight">CS107 Computer Organization & Systems</span> 
              and <span class="highlight">CS161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms</span>. Both courses pushed me to my limits 
              and helped me grow as a computer scientist.
            </p>
            
            <h2>CS107: Deep Dive into Systems</h2>
            <p>
              CS107 is my favorite course this summer, and I'm proud to say I earned an <span class="highlight">A+ (99/100)</span>. 
              The homework was exceptionally well designed and perfectly solidified the knowledge we learned in lectures—it was 
              my favorite part, super interesting, and I learned tremendously from each assignment.

              <h3>Assignment 7: Heap Allocator</h3>
              <p>
                This was my absolute favorite assignment. Not only did I complete all the required functions, but I also 
                finished all the challenge functions that weren't required. I wanted to see how far I could push myself, 
                and I made it! I created a new structure that adds a footer at the end of free blocks to find the previous 
                block, implementing a bidirectional free list that significantly improved allocation efficiency.

              <h3>Assignment 6: Banking on Security</h3>
              <p>
                The Security Bomb assignment was one of the most intriguing challenges I've ever encountered. I successfully 
                found vulnerabilities in the virtual bank and "stole the money"—all in a controlled, educational environment, 
                of course! This assignment inspired me to explore real-life vulnerabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Security Contribution to Stanford:</strong> Going beyond the assignment, I discovered critical vulnerabilities 
                in Stanford's AFS (Andrew File System). Following responsible disclosure practices learned in the course, I:

              <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Identified and documented the security vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Developed comprehensive solutions and patches</li>
                <li>Submitted a detailed report following Stanford's disclosure protocols</li>
                <li>Collaborated with the engineering team on implementation</li>
              </ul>

			  <strong>Huge thanks to Adam Keppler</strong> for helping me connect with the corresponding engineer, and to <a href="#alex-keller" style="color:#1772d0;"><strong>Alex Keller</strong></a> from the engineering team—we had a very productive conversation 
                about system security and implementing the solutions I proposed.

              <p class="image-caption">With Adam Keppler after our final lecture</p>
              
              <p>
                Adam's teaching is simply amazing. He showed up to <em>every single lecture</em> with no exceptions, even though 
                we had two instructors. His dedication was inspiring. We had wonderful conversations about computer systems concepts, 
                my discovery of vulnerabilities, life, and everything in between.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I had never used GDB before this course, and I excitedly told him that I found a way to bypass the "bank protection 
                alert" in our security assignment. He appreciated that I was a quick learner and encouraged me to explore further.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                "I always asked tons of questions in lectures (that's pretty much why I sat in the first row!). Even when some 
                questions were basic, Adam patiently answered my confusion and followed my thanks with a big smile and 'Absolutely!' 
                His positive responses always inspired and encouraged students to think deeply."
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I genuinely believe Adam's teaching style and encouragement were key factors in my success in this course.

              <p>
                Big thanks to Ola! Ola's humorous tone and teaching style made dense or potentially boring content feel 
                interesting and relaxing. The analogies and live demos helped me connect the dots between lecture material 
                and assignments in ways I hadn't expected.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                After class, Ola was always friendly and open to questions, offering clear explanations of complex concepts 
                that really helped solidify my understanding. Whether it was pointer arithmetic or assembly language intricacies, 
                Ola had a way of making everything click.

              <p>
                Ben Yan is, without a doubt, the best TA I have ever met. His slides weren't just informative—they were 
                engaging and sometimes even entertaining. His teaching was super fluent, like that of a seasoned lecturer, 
                and the meticulous, rigorous comments on our homework were incredibly helpful.

              <blockquote>
                "Please stick to your teaching—it's terrific, and I want to be the first student when you become a lecturer!"
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>
                Ben's discussion section was highlight of my week. He had this remarkable ability to break down complex 
                topics into digestible pieces while maintaining technical rigor. His feedback on assignments went above and 
                beyond, often including additional resources and suggestions for further exploration.

              <img src="../../images/blog/Me_and_Alex.jpg" alt="With Alex" class="blog-image">

              <p>
                A huge thanks to <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/spotlight/alex-keller" style="color:#1772d0;">Alex Keller</a>, 
                Stanford's Senior Systems Security Engineer, who took time from his busy schedule to discuss the AFS vulnerabilities 
                I discovered. Our productive conversation covered not just the technical aspects of the security issues, but also 
                broader topics about systems security and career paths in the field.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                What struck me most was Alex's philosophy: <em>"If you do good work at Stanford, you will be rewarded with 
                opportunities to do more good work."</em> This perspective helped me understand that contributing to Stanford's 
                security through responsible disclosure was valuable experience in itself—and motivation to continue learning 
                and contributing wherever possible.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Alex brings unique expertise to Stanford, having coached <a href="https://applied-cyber.stanford.edu/" style="color:#1772d0;">Stanford Applied Cyber</a> 
                for 10 years. During our meeting, he showed me the team's training facilities and shared insights about competitive 
                cybersecurity. His dedication recently paid off with Applied Cyber winning 1st place in both the ICS (Industrial Control Systems) 
                and Goldbug CTFs in Las Vegas—an impressive achievement for the team.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Our discussion ranged from technical details of AFS architecture to career advice for aspiring systems engineers. 
                Alex's willingness to mentor students and dedication to helping students with passion to chase their dream made our conversation particularly valuable. 
                It's a shame that we didn't take a pic together but I believe we will see soon!

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
              CS 107 wasn't just about learning C programming or understanding computer architecture—it was about developing 
              a systems mindset. Through this course, I:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Mastered low-level programming and memory management</li>
              <li>Gained practical experience with debugging tools like GDB and Valgrind</li>
              <li>Developed a security-conscious approach to systems programming</li>
              <li>Made real-world security contributions to Stanford's infrastructure</li>
              <li>Learned and practiced responsible vulnerability disclosure</li>
              <li>Built lasting connections with amazing instructors and engineering team</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>CS161: The Art of Algorithm Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              CS161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms was equally transformative, earning me an <span class="highlight">A (93/100)</span>. 
              Before this course, I was lost in the maze of algorithmic complexity. How do you compare quicksort to mergesort? 
              Why does one hash table outperform another? The sheer variety of algorithms and performance metrics seemed overwhelming.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              CS161 taught me the <strong>fundamental philosophy</strong> that changed everything: evaluate algorithms analytically, not just empirically. 
              Instead of just running code and timing it, we learned to ask deeper questions:
            </p>
            
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
              <li><strong>Input Analysis:</strong> What happens in the best, worst, and average cases?</li>
              <li><strong>Algorithm Decisions:</strong> How do pivot choices in quicksort or hash functions affect performance?</li>
              <li><strong>Amortized Analysis:</strong> What's the cost over a sequence of operations, not just one?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              This systematic approach transformed abstract concepts into concrete tools. Whether analyzing AVL tree rotations, 
              understanding why hash tables achieve O(1) average time, or proving lower bounds for comparison sorting, 
              the course provided a rigorous framework for thinking about efficiency.

                (<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs161/notes.pdf" style="color:#1772d0;">CS161 Notes</a>). 
                Matthew considered everything comprehensively—the thinking behind lectures (I mean the pace and step-by-step 
                depth) and even the snacks for asking questions were awesome!
              </p>
              
              <p>
                He always repeats and interprets the questions asked by other students, which is so helpful because 
                I sometimes couldn't hear or didn't understand what they said. This thoughtful approach made complex 
                algorithm analysis accessible to everyone.

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>
              My summer at Stanford fundamentally changed how I think about computer science. CS107 gave me deep systems 
              knowledge while CS161 provided the analytical tools to evaluate and design efficient algorithms. The combination 
              of theoretical knowledge and hands-on implementation has given me confidence to tackle complex problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              To anyone considering Stanford's summer session: these courses are challenging but incredibly rewarding. 
              With passionate instructors and a supportive community, you're not just learning material—you're developing 
              a new way of thinking about computation.
