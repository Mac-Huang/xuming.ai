Dear Product Design Engineering Hiring Team,

I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, applying for the Product Design Engineering Intern (BS/MS), Summer 2026 role. I am drawn to cross‑disciplinary work at the boundary of hardware and software, and I enjoy turning constraints into practical, testable designs. My background in systems, performance analysis, and hardware–software co‑design—paired with a willingness to ramp quickly on CAD and mechanical simulation—positions me to contribute alongside product design engineers.

I build rigorous, measurement‑driven prototypes. Recently, I created interactive systems visualizations (a CPU cache hierarchy simulator, a heap allocator visualizer, and a compiler pipeline demo) to reason about memory, performance, and low‑level trade‑offs. These projects emphasize clear interfaces, reproducible experiments, and careful documentation—habits I bring to physical product development as well.

I also work on ML‑adjacent systems where performance and reliability matter. I’m building a heterogeneous CPU–GPU task scheduler in C/CUDA (with cuBLAS optimizations and memory pooling) that dispatches work based on compute and transfer characteristics, and I contribute to LinuxGuard, an AI‑assisted kernel security analysis pipeline using RAG and clustering to surface vulnerability patterns. These efforts sharpen my ability to formalize requirements, design experiments, and iterate quickly with evidence.

Academically, I completed Stanford’s CS107 (Computer Organization & Systems, A+) and CS161 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms, A). At UW–Madison, I’m focused on digital systems and machine organization (CS 352/CS 354), reinforcing fundamentals in logic design, memory hierarchy, and performance optimization. While my experience centers on software/system design rather than mechanical CAD, I learn tools quickly and am prepared to ramp on parametric CAD workflows (e.g., Creo/NX) and basic mechanical simulation. I’m comfortable scripting analysis in Python to automate param sweeps, parse simulation output, and produce decision‑ready reports.

I’m excited by Google’s collaborative engineering culture and the opportunity to work on products where electrical, mechanical, and software constraints meet. I would be glad to contribute to design validation, data analysis for tests, rapid prototyping, and design automation support. I am open to Mountain View, Ann Arbor, or other listed locations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my systems background, rapid prototyping habits, and eagerness to learn CAD tools could support your team this summer. My resume is attached; project write‑ups are available upon request.

Sincerely,

Xuming Huang
