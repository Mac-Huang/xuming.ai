Dear Student Researcher Hiring Team,

I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, applying for the Student Researcher (BS/MS), Fall 2025 position. My interests span machine learning, deep learning, and systems, with hands‑on experience building research prototypes and educational tools. I am especially motivated by problems that combine algorithmic rigor with practical systems concerns—performance, memory, reliability—and I’m eager to contribute to Google’s research efforts.

My recent work focuses on ML‑for‑systems and systems‑for‑ML:
- LinuxGuard (ongoing): an AI‑assisted kernel security analysis pipeline. I designed a RAG‑enhanced detection workflow that achieves ~72% precision on kernel vulnerability patterns and used clustering (K‑means, TF‑IDF) to derive high‑confidence anti‑patterns. Advisors include Prof. Remzi Arpaci‑Dusseau and Vinay Banakar.
- Heterogeneous CPU–GPU Task Scheduler (ongoing): a C/CUDA runtime with cuBLAS optimizations and memory pooling that automatically dispatches tasks between CPU and GPU based on workload/transfer characteristics.
- Multispectral U‑Net Segmentation (preprint): architecture exploration for segmentation in multispectral domains; built training/eval pipelines and ran controlled ablations.

To communicate and test ideas, I also build interactive visualizations and teaching tools: a CPU cache hierarchy simulator, a heap allocator visualizer, a compiler pipeline demo, graph and sorting algorithm visualizers, and deep‑dive tutorials on Transformers and GPT. These projects emphasize clear experimental setup, measurement, and explanation—skills I will bring to collaborative research.

Academically, I completed Stanford’s CS107 (Computer Organization & Systems, A+) and CS161 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms, A), and I regularly apply algorithmic techniques (graphs, DP), data structures, profiling, and debugging in my projects. I am comfortable with Python, C/C++, CUDA, and JavaScript, and with Git‑based workflows and basic testing for reproducibility.

I am excited by Google’s breadth of research—ML, systems and infrastructure, developer tools, and safety—and I would be happy to contribute to teams working in Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Software Engineering for ML systems, or related areas. I’m open to Mountain View, Ann Arbor, or other listed locations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in ML and systems could support your research this fall. My resume is attached, and I can share project write‑ups or code samples upon request.

Sincerely,

Xuming Huang
