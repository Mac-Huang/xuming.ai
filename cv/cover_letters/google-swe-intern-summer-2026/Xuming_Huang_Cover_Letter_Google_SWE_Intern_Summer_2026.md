Dear Hiring Team,

I am a B.S. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison applying for the Software Engineering Intern (BS), Summer 2026 role. I have hands-on experience building software in multiple languages (primarily Python, C/C++, and JavaScript) and a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and debugging—both from coursework and self-driven projects. I am excited about the opportunity to learn from and contribute to engineering teams at Google.

Across my recent projects and coursework, I’ve implemented classical data structures and algorithmic techniques (graphs, dynamic programming, concurrency primitives), and used them to build small end‑to‑end applications. I’ve worked with Python for experimentation and tooling, C/C++ for performance‑sensitive components, and JavaScript for minimal interactive front ends. I am comfortable in Git-based workflows, code reviews, and writing tests to validate correctness and guard against regressions. I enjoy translating open‑ended requirements into well‑scoped tasks, then iterating quickly with clear, maintainable code.

I’m particularly drawn to Google’s emphasis on code quality, scale, and mentorship. The chance to collaborate with engineers across product areas—Search, Maps, Cloud, Android, or YouTube—while learning production best practices is exactly what I’m looking for. I’m motivated by problems that require thoughtful trade‑offs between performance, reliability, and simplicity, and I’d be eager to contribute on backend, infrastructure, or ML‑adjacent teams. I’m open to Mountain View, Atlanta, or other listed locations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and drive to learn could contribute to your team this summer. I’ve included my resume and can share code samples or project write‑ups upon request.

Sincerely,

Xuming Huang
