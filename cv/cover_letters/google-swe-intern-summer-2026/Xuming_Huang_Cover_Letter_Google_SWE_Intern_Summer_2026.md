Dear University Programs Hiring Team,

I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, applying for the Software Engineering Intern (BS), Summer 2026 role. I program in Python, C/C++, and JavaScript, and have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms from coursework and projects. Last summer I completed Stanford’s CS107 (Computer Organization & Systems, A+) and CS161 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms, A), which sharpened my systems and algorithmic problem‑solving skills.

Previously, at CoolAI, I built customer‑facing demos for a China Business Network (CBN) interview and represented the company at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC). That experience taught me to translate technical capabilities into clear narratives and to ship demo features under tight timelines.

My current research explores practical systems for ML: LinuxGuard, an AI‑assisted kernel security analysis pipeline (with RAG‑enhanced detection achieving ~72% precision on vulnerability patterns); and a heterogeneous CPU–GPU task scheduler implemented in C/CUDA with cuBLAS, memory pooling, and runtime dispatch. I also worked on multispectral U‑Net segmentation (preprint). Across these efforts, I write clean code, version it with Git, and validate behavior with tests or measurable metrics.

I’m drawn to Google’s engineering culture—code quality at scale, mentorship, and impact. I’d be excited to contribute on backend, infrastructure, or ML‑adjacent teams, and I am open to Mountain View, Atlanta, or other listed locations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasm for systems and ML could contribute to your team this summer. My resume is attached; I’m happy to share project write‑ups as needed.

Sincerely,

Xuming Huang
