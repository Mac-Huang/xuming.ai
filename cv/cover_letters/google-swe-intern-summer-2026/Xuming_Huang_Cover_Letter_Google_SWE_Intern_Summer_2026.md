Dear University Programs Hiring Team,

I am a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, applying for the Software Engineering Intern (BS), Summer 2026 role. I program in Python, C/C++, and JavaScript, and have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms from coursework and projects. Last summer I completed Stanford’s CS107 (Computer Organization & Systems, A+) and CS161 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms, A), which sharpened my systems and algorithmic problem‑solving skills.

I enjoy building at the intersection of systems and machine learning. Recently, I built interactive systems visualizations—including a CPU cache hierarchy simulator, a heap allocator visualizer, and an end‑to‑end compiler pipeline demo—to deepen my understanding of performance, memory, and optimization. On the ML side, I created tutorials and educational repos (e.g., a Transformer deep‑dive and a GPT implementation guide) and small playgrounds for neural networks, tensors, and graph algorithms. These projects emphasize clear design, maintainable code, and careful measurement.

My current research explores practical systems for ML: LinuxGuard, an AI‑assisted kernel security analysis pipeline (with RAG‑enhanced detection achieving ~72% precision on vulnerability patterns); and a heterogeneous CPU–GPU task scheduler implemented in C/CUDA with cuBLAS, memory pooling, and runtime dispatch. I also worked on multispectral U‑Net segmentation (preprint). Across these efforts, I write clean code, version it with Git, and validate behavior with tests or measurable metrics.

I’m drawn to Google’s engineering culture—code quality at scale, mentorship, and impact. I’d be excited to contribute on backend, infrastructure, or ML‑adjacent teams, and I am open to Mountain View, Atlanta, or other listed locations.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasm for systems and ML could contribute to your team this summer. My resume is attached; I’m happy to share project write‑ups as needed.

Sincerely,

Xuming Huang
